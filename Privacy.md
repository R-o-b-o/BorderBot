**What data does this bot store?**

- Guild IDs
- User IDs
- Avatars
- Provided images

**Why do we need the data?**

    a) Guilds IDs' are stored for configuration settings (such as custom prefix and slideshow)

    b) User IDs' are stored for avatar association as well as blacklisting / command logging
    
    c) Avatars are stored for border image creation and history command

    d) User provided images are used for their provided purpose only (guild icon slideshow, texture border, etc...)

**Other than Discord, do we share your data with any 3rd parties?**

No, we do not share data with any 3rd parties!

**How can users get data removed, or how can users contact the bot owner?**

To remove collected avatars a user can use removeavatarhistory, otherwise they can contact the owner by joining the support server (shown in help) and file a request to remove all associated data.
